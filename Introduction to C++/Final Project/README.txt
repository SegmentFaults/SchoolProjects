How to operate the program:
Run the Main.cpp.
You must first make an account and remember your username and password.
After you make your account it will take you back to the main screen. 
Usernames and passwords are persistent.
After this, you can either be a student, professor or an administrator.

Everything created within admin will remain persistent for the future. This is the bulk of the program.

You can create students and courses from this screen.

Depending on which you are it depends on what you can do from these screens.

Problems: I had extremely large trouble working with multiple classes. I wasted roughly 3 hours trying to figure out a compile error where my header files were circularly referenced. I then discovered that I needed to declare these as class NameOfClass so that the headers would work together. After this error, I had a large amount of trouble working with static variables. I needed static variables to set up a persistent style. Following these issues, I wasted about 2 hours working with binding, even though I did not need binding for what I was doing.
I dedicated 21 hours of time to the code. Much of this is not reflected into the code that is written. I went through multiple revisions. Due to the scope of the project that I desired, it caused clutered code bases that I had to delete and remake. I also ran out of time to create a persistent list of courses that each student was taking. I had already done the 20 hours of work, so I did not feel it was necessary.

Challenges: I did not fully understand OOP in C++. I did not understand how header files worked and spent a large amount of time learning how to use them with multiple classes. I also did not understand how to structure my code so that I could work with private variables, static variables and public variables. This project would have been very simple in Java, although in C++ I had problems with stuff that we had not worked with during class.

Done differently:
I would have not taken on such an ambitious project. I cannot do the work that I made for myself in my project outline. I would have done alot more research on how to work with classes ahead of time rather than jumping in head first. I also would have created more bindings to structures.
